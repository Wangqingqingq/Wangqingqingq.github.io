I am a Theoretical Cosmologist at Hefei Institute of Technology, China. My main research interests lie in the fields of dark matter, dark energy, and quantum effects in cosmological systems. I am particularly interested in using quantum information methods as a constructive methodology for fundamental physics.

Beyond Work
======
When I'm not immersed in research work, you'll find that I have a wide range of interestsâ€”from fascinating science fiction films and philosophical works to singing and dancing. <br>I particularly enjoy brainstorming, even without practical rewards (though occasionally it pays offðŸ˜€, like discovering new research topics), as it provides interesting intellectual challenges and fresh stimulation.
