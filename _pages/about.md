I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Science and Technology of China and Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, specializing in cosmology. My primary research interests include weak gravitational lensing, dark energy, and modified gravity theories. I have previously employed galaxy-galaxy lensing to investigate dark matter distributions, halo properties, and gravitational theories. I am also interested in dynamical dark energy and clustering dark energy.
