I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Science and Technology of China, pecializing in cosmology. My primary research interests include weak gravitational lensing, dark energy, and modified gravity theories. I have previously employed galaxy-galaxy lensing to investigate dark matter distributions, halo proprieties, and gravitational theories.  I am also interested in dynamical dark energy and the clustering dark energy.
